- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Connection-oriented protocol
  - Three-way handshake observed
  - Reliable data transmission
  - Flow control mechanisms

#### 2. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- **Port Number**: 80
- **Packet Count**: [Count from analysis]
- **Purpose**: Web page requests and responses
- **Observations**:
  - GET requests to various domains
  - Response codes (200, 404, etc.)
  - Clear text protocol (visible content)

#### 3. HTTPS/TLS (Secure HTTP)
- **Port Number**: 443
- **Packet Count**: [Count from analysis]
- **Purpose**: Encrypted web communication
- **Observations**:
  - TLS handshake sequences
  - Encrypted application data
  - Certificate exchanges

#### 4. DNS (Domain Name System)
- **Port Number**: 53 (UDP)
- **Packet Count**: 446
- **Purpose**: Domain name resolution
- **Observations**:
  - A record queries
  - Response with IP addresses
  - Query-response pairs

#### 5. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- **Various Ports**: 53, 123, etc.
- **Purpose**: Fast, connectionless transport
- **Observations**:
  - No connection establishment
  - Lower overhead than TCP
  - Used for DNS and other services

#### 6. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)3
- **Purpose**: Network diagnostics
- **Observations**:
  - Ping echo requests/replies
  - Network reachability testing
  - Error message reporting

## üìà Key Findings

### Traffic Patterns
- **Most Active Protocol**: TCP
- **Primary Communication**: Web browsing traffic (HTTP/HTTPS)
- **DNS Activity**: Frequent domain resolution queries
- **Security Observations**: Mix of encrypted and unencrypted traffic

### Network Behavior
- **Peak Traffic**: During web browsing activities
- **Connection Patterns**: Multiple concurrent TCP connections
- **Protocol Distribution**: Predominantly TCP-based protocols
- **Background Activity**: System maintenance and update traffic

### Interesting Observations
1. **TLS Encryption**: Most web traffic is encrypted (HTTPS)
2. **DNS Queries**: Frequent lookups for domain resolution
3. **Keep-Alive Connections**: HTTP persistent connections observed
4. **Port Usage**: Standard ports (80, 443, 53) heavily utilized

## üìù Wireshark Display Filters Used

| Filter              | Purpose                        | Example                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| `http`              | Show HTTP traffic only         | Web requests/responses |
| `dns`               | Show DNS queries/responses     | Domain name lookups    |
| `tcp.port == 443`   | Show HTTPS traffic             | Secure web connections |
| `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1` | Show traffic to/from specific IP | Router communication   |
| `icmp`              | Show ping/diagnostics          | Network tests          |

## üöÄ How to Reproduce

1. **Install Wireshark**
   # On Windows: Download from wireshark.org
   ```
2. **Start Packet Capture**
   - Launch Wireshark
   - Select active network interface
   - Click "Start capturing packets"
3. **Generate Traffic**
   ```bash
   # DNS queries
   nslookup google.com
   ping github.com

   # Web browsing
   curl -I https://www.example.com
   ```
4. **Analyze Capture**
   - Use display filters to isolate protocols
   - Examine packet details and headers
   - Export capture as .pcap file
   ```
   
## üéì Learning Outcomes

### Technical Skills Gained
- **Network Protocol Understanding**: Deep dive into TCP/IP stack
- **Packet Analysis**: Ability to interpret network traffic
- **Security Awareness**: Understanding of encrypted vs. unencrypted traffic
- **Troubleshooting Skills**: Network diagnostics and problem identification

### Cybersecurity Insights
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Importance of network visibility
- **Protocol Security**: Vulnerabilities in plain text protocols
- **Network Forensics**: Using packet analysis for incident response
- **Baseline Understanding**: Normal vs. suspicious network behavior

## Security and Privacy Considerations

‚ö†**Important Note**: This packet capture was performed on a personal network with proper authorization. No sensitive or personal data from other users was captured or analyzed. All analysis was conducted in accordance with ethical hacking principles and local regulations.

### Best Practices Followed
- Only captured traffic on owned/authorized networks
- No interception of other users' private communications
- Secure storage of capture files
- No sharing of sensitive network information

## Interview Preparation

### Key Questions and Answers

**Q: What is Wireshark used for?**
A: Network protocol analysis, troubleshooting, security monitoring, and educational purposes to understand network communications.

**Q: What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**
A: TCP is connection-oriented, reliable, and provides error checking, while UDP is connectionless, faster, but doesn't guarantee delivery.

**Q: How can packet capture help in cybersecurity?**
A: It enables detection of malicious traffic, network intrusion analysis, forensic investigation, and understanding of attack patterns.
